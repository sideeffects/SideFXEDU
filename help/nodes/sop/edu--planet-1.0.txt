    ==== Textures ====

    Planet textures are not distributed with the HDA but can be downloaded from the internet.
    Here are a few examples:
    - [Solar System Scope | https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/]
    - [Planet Texture Maps Wiki | https://planet-texture-maps.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Texture_Maps_Wiki]


    The HDA uses a Principle Shader. Refer to the [Principle Shader help page | /nodes/vop/principledshader] for more information.

    ==== Body ====

    Base color:
        #id: body_basecolor_texture
        The overall color of the surface of the planet.
        
    Specular:
        #id: body_ior_texture
        How light is reflected of the surface of the planet.
        
    Normal:
        #id: body_baseNormal_texture
        The normal map for the planet's material.
        
    ==== Atmosphere ====

    Use Atmosphere:
        #id: use_atmos
        Whether to display the planet's atmosphere or not.

    Base color:
