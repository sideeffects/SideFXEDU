"""This HDA demonstrate how a bezier curve is built."""


WARNING:
    This node is made for education purposes only. You can use it for other things, but at your own risks.

This HDA demonstrate how a bezier curve is built visualizing intermediate points and traversals.

@parameters

    Use Input Points:
        #id: use_input_points
        If a geometry is plugged in, it uses its points as control points to build the bezier curve. If not, it uses the points defined inside the HDA.
        
    Use Animated Progress:
        #id: use_anim_progress
        If checked-on, the HDA uses the timeline to build the curve. If OFF, it uses the next parameter.
        Note: currently the curve is only visible when this parameter is ON. When it's OFF, only the point on the final curve is visible.
        
    Progress:
        #id: progress
        When "Use Animated Curve" is OFF, use this parameter to show the progression of the building of the curve.
