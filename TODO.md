# Alpha (Experimental branch)
**Solar System**  
An HDA, or maybe a set of HDAs, to build a star system like our solar system. We curently have a Planet HDA building block which we use to build the `hip/solar_system_demoscene.hip` file.
We are awaiting feedback from users to know which direction we should go with this.

**Bezier Curve**  
An HDA to visualize the principles behind the building of a bezier curve.

# WIP
**Camera Lens**  
An HDA to visualize how rays travel inside a camera lens. The goal is to be able to understand in/out of focus, zoom, and hopefully aberations.

**Quaternion Visualizer**  
An HDA to hopefully help understand what is a quaternion and how quaternion interpolation works.

**Sudivisions**
An HDA to explain how subdivisions are created.

# Not started
**Velocity, Speed, Acceleration**  
An HDA to visualize what is a velocity, what is speed, and what is acceleration.

**Dot Product Explainer**  

**Cross Product Explainer**  
  
**Sampling Explainer**  
An HDA to explain how sampling works and what conditions to meet to repdroduce a signal correctly.

**Substeps Visualizer**  
An HDA that would help understand how substeps work and how they matter for simulations.
